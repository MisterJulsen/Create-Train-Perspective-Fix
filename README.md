# Create Addon: Train Perspective Fix

![Logo](https://github.com/MisterJulsen/Create-Train-Perspective-Fix/blob/forge/icon_256px.png)
 
#### **A very small mod that fixes the problem that the player on a train does not rotate with it while driving.**

This mod requires the [Create Mod v0.5.1a](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) or newer for Forge or the [Create Fabric Mod v0.5.1b](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-fabric) or newer for Fabric.

## **Content**
Maybe it's just me, but it really bothers me personally when I'm sitting on a train and it takes a curve and my character doesn't turn with it. This mod is intended to solve exactly this problem. When the mod is installed, the player rotates along with the moving trains, but you can still look around freely. This only works while sitting. When you just stand on a train, nothing changes.

## **Supported Versions**
The same version of this mod can be used in all versions from 1.18 and with both Forge and Fabric. The mod is also only needed on the clients. The mod is also client-side only. It doesn't have to be installed on the server and would either do nothing there or even crash the server!
